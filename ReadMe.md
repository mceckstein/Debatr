DebatR Project
==============

Simple prototype that demonstrates Node, Express, JADE and AngularJs functionality.  It was conceived as an ideal project for learning about these technologies.

This web application lets users pose questions that are then voted on by the public.  This project is based on the Node/Express/Angular seed project at btford/angular-express-seed@5a1134e70230f0d9d05239bd686d5f3a261db32c.


Limitations
-----------
* Right now, this project uses an in-memory database that is cleared when the node process exites.
* No test suite, will investigate casper.js in the future
